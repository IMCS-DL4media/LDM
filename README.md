# LDM
DL Lifecycle Data Management Framework.
A framework for capturing all relevant events and artefacts during the DL training process, 
as well as a web interface for inspecting them.

One of the most important features of our framework are listed below:
 - create a new experiment - a project
 - add training data sets (training data set, test data set) to this project
 - record the progress of an ongoing experiment (create log entries and save experiment run metadata)
 - save files used in the experiment
